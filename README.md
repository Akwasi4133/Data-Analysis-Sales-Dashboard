## Tools Used
- Power BI
  
## Recommended Analysis
- Identifying profit-driving product categories across store locations.
- Which stores are the most profitable, and how can this guide store expansion decisions?
- Unveiling seasonal trends or patterns in sales data.
- Investigating sales impact due to out-of-stock products.
- Evaluating inventory investment and duration. 

## Methodology
This Power BI analysis workflow starts with importing and cleaning CSV data, then shaping it in Power Query to prepare for modeling. Relevant relationships between tables are established, and DAX calculations are created to define essential metrics like revenue and profit. Visuals, such as bar charts and line graphs, along with dynamic filters, are added to explore trends by product category, region, and time period. Finally, the report is published in Power BI Service, allowing stakeholders to interact with insights and make informed strategic decisions

## Key Insights:
- Top-Performing Location: The Downtown area stands out as the leading revenue generator, contributing $8.22M in sales and $2.25M in profit across 29 stores, highlighting the value of prime locations.

- Category Performance: Toys have proven to be a major driver, accounting for 36% of total sales ($5.1M) and 27% of profit ($1.1M). This underscores the effectiveness of targeted product strategies.

- Highest-Profit Store: The Ciudad de Mexico 2 store has the highest profitability, bringing in $170K in profit, which suggests that localized store strategies can greatly impact revenue.

- Inventory Insights: Our analysis revealed no direct correlation between stock levels and profit, indicating that optimal inventory management can be achieved without surplus stock.

- Seasonal Sales Patterns: December emerged as the top month for revenue, with $877K in sales, demonstrating a strong opportunity for targeted seasonal promotions and inventory planning.

- Stock on Hand vs Profit had zero correlation as having high or low stock does not correlate with high or low profit.


## Strategic Recommendations:
To support continued revenue growth, Maven should focus on ensuring optimal inventory levels for high-demand product categories at key locations, especially during peak sales periods. Prioritizing seasonal promotions and aligning inventory with expected demand can further enhance sales impact. Applying these insights will allow Maven to expand its reach effectively while optimizing profitability.
